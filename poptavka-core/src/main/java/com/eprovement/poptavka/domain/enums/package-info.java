/**
 * This package should contain all public enums used in poptavka-core modul.
 * The idea behind this is that we want to share these enums with poptavka-web module on client side, therefore
 * they have to be specified in GWT configuration file and it is more handy and safer to have all such enums
 * in one package and allow sharing of only this one package.
